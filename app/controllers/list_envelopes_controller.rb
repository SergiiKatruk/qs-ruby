  # This example does not include authentication. Instead, an access token
  # must be supplied from the Token Generator tool on the DevCenter or from
  # elsewhere.
  #
  # This example also does not look up the DocuSign account id to be used.
  # Instead, the account id must be set.

  # For a more production oriented example, see the
  # Authorization code grant authentication example:

    # Step 1. Create a date string for 10 days ago and call the API
    # The Envelopes::listStatusChanges method has many options
    # See https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/reference/Envelopes/Envelopes/listStatusChange#
    # The list status changes call requires at least a from_date OR
    # a set of envelopeIds. Here we filter using a from_date.
    # Here we set the from_date to filter envelopes for the last month
    # # Use ISO 8601 date format
